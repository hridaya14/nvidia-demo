    Generate comprehensive documentation for **"{title}"** based on the verified codebase at **{repo_path}**.
    Focus strictly on factual, code-derived information — exclude all media (images, videos, etc).

    Include:
      - **Project Overview:** {overview}
      - **High-Level Description:** {description}
      - **Prerequisites:** {prerequisites}
      - **Examples:** {examples}

    Requirements:
      - Derive all details solely from code and verified analysis.
      - Use `mermaid` diagrams (not images) to represent architectures, flows, and relationships.
      - Highlight module hierarchies, dependencies, and workflows.
      - Reference actual filenames, classes, or functions wherever possible.

  expected_output: |
    ✅ **Expected Output:**
    A clear, factual Markdown document about {title} at {repo_path}, containing:
      - Section headers matching real code structure
      - Accurate technical explanations and code references
      - Verified code examples (no pseudocode)
      - Verified setup and usage instructions
      - `mermaid` diagrams for relationships and flows

    Notes:
      - Do **not** wrap the output in code fences or add meta-commentary.
      - Exclude any speculative, unimplemented, or media-based content.

    Review and fact-check the documentation for **"{title}"** against the codebase at **{repo_path}**.
    Ensure the documentation is accurate, consistent, and complete — aligned fully with implementation.
    Ignore images, videos, and unverified external data.

    Review Checklist:
      1. **Technical Accuracy**
         - Architectural descriptions match actual code
         - Component interactions and relationships are valid
         - Code examples reflect real functions/tests
         - `mermaid` diagrams show true control/data flows
      2. **Completeness**
         - All major modules, workflows, and integrations are covered
         - No undocumented or duplicate sections
      3. **Quality**
         - Remove speculative or outdated content
         - Ensure examples and setup steps match real usage
      4. **Consistency**
         - Terminology and naming align with source code
         - Code snippets follow project’s actual style
      5. **Diagram Validation**
         - All diagram elements exist in the codebase
         - Flow direction and hierarchy accurately represent logic
         - Wrap mermaid blocks in ```mermaid``` syntax

  expected_output: |
    ✅ **Expected Output:**
    A corrected and validated Markdown documentation for {title} that:
      - Reflects 100% accurate implementation details from {repo_path}
      - Contains verified examples and workflows only
      - Uses valid `mermaid` diagrams consistent with system behavior
      - Maintains uniform terminology and formatting
      - Contains no commentary, speculative text, or code fences
